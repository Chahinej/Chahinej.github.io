# My Wardrobe 

The My Wardrobe REST API is a web application that allows users to manage their wardrobe collection and get suggestions for the perfect outfit based on the weather.
Users can create an account and login to the application using their email and password. Once logged in, they can add new items to their wardrobe by specifying the type of article, color, size, material and season.
Users can also view and modify the items in their wardrobe, as well as delete items that they no longer need.
The API provides a number of endpoints for creating, modifying, deleting, and querying the wardrobe items, as well as for user authentication and authorization.
Additionally, the API also uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for a given city and suggest the best top and bottom clothes for the current temperature.
